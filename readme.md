![ArchiveFuzz](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Grumpy-developer/ArchiveFuzz/master/static/banner.PNG)
# What the heck is this thing ? 

ArchiveFuzz hunts down the archived data(subdomains/emails/API keys) of domains. **Web archiving** is the process of collecting portions of the [World Wide Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web "World Wide Web") to ensure the information is [preserved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_preservation "Digital preservation") in an [archive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archive "Archive") for future researchers, historians, and the public.

This tool uses webarchive's cdx to enumerate Emails/Subdomains/IPs/API tokens .

# But why ?
I initially made ArchiveFuzz for my personal use , Now making it public . This really helped me a lot , Good luck finding potential assets with this <3 

# Example

Lets scan mail.ru for archived secrets :

`python archivehunter.py mail.ru`
